- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


Honestly, I find encapsulation a little confusing. I think I understand how it works, but at the same time, I can't think of a good reason to make an attribute public, so I've just been making all of mine private. I don't see why for any of the attributes we made, they should be changed from the outside. 

I liked this assignment, I found it pretty clear. I found it really helpful to block out what I was going to do on paper so I understood things better before I started coding. It was also helpful for making sure I had all my ducks (requirements) in a row. 
As always, many little tests throughout writing the code were helpful. 
Kind of confused though why the main program for testing had to be put inside the class and it didn't work outside?
